### Description  
An app based on the idea of helping users to choose a wine to drink when they don't know or don't have the time to choose one. Users are guided through four rounds of questios that filters the wines and at the end, displays the perfect match.

### Getting Started
*You’ll need to have Node 8.16.0 or Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine*(but it’s not required on the server). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.
To deploy with Surge, also ensure you have a recent version of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)Then, install Surge using npm by running the following command:
npm install --global surge
