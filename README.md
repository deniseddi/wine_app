### About this app:  
"Wine Time" was based on the idea of recommending wine to users that don't know how to choose a wine or have a limited time to do so. This app is meant to be fun, easy and quick to use; resulting in a great user experience.   
* Users are guided through four rounds of questions
* The questions help to filter down the wine options available from the app's wine list.
* After the last question, it displays the perfect match.  


### Getting Started:
You’ll need to have Node 8.16.0 or Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine(but it’s not required on the server). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.
To deploy with Surge, also ensure you have a recent version of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) . Then, install Surge using npm by running the following command:
npm install --global surge

### Technologies used:
* React
* CSS 5

### Wish to have:
* An interactive React world map, displaying the popular wine regions.
